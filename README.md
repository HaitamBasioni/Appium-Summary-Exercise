   - Parallelism
        - Your tests should run in parallel
   - Assertions
        - Use the most accurate assertions
   - Reporting
        - Test results should be presented using allure report
   - Infrastructure
        - Code should be structured in layers (infra, logic, tests)
        - Selenium should not be revealed to the tests layer
        - Use POM
   - GIT
        - Use pull requests and have code reviews
        - Use informative commit messages
   - Stability
        - Make sure your tests pass consistently, no flaky tests!
